These samples are not 3 seconds long they are 2.9721 seconds long. 
Because of the chunksize we cannot use the whole sample for feature extraction. 
When we record three times 1s in the prototype we get about 2.7s of data so we 
need to prune the unnecessary end from these samples when we create a dataset
for model training!!!!!!!!!!
We need only 122880 samples from these files and then downsample the data down to 30720 samples with decimation facter of 4
Also there might be missing values with the speeds so use the audiofiles that have an id in the speeds file.
